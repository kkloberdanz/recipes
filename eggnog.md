# Bourbon Eggnog Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 12 Egg yolks
- 3 Cups whole milk
- 3 Cups heavy whipping cream
- 3 Cups bourbon (I use Bullet Bourbon)
- 2.25 Cups sugar
- 1 Whole nutmeg (finely grated)

## Procedure:

### Separate egg yolks

Only the yolks are needed. Separate the whites from the yolks. The whites can
be used later for another purpose.

### Beat the yolks

Beat the yolks in a stand mixer until they lighten slightly in color.
Slowly mix in the sugar.

### Mix in the liquids

Mix in the milk and heavy whipping cream. After fully combined with the egg
yolks, slowly mix the Bourbon in - ensure you are constantly mixing to avoid
denaturing the egg yolks.

> Warning: If the Bourbon is added directly to the yolks without mixing, then
the yolks coagulate and the mixture becomes unpleasantly chunky. Ensure the
Bourbon is added slowly while mixing.

### Age the eggnog

This recipe makes some very boozy eggnog. At first it will taste too strong.
Pour the eggnog into sealable containers, and keep refrigerated for at least
two days. This is best served after two weeks of aging in the refrigerator.
This eggnog will taste much much better with age.
